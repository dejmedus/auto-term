Auto Terminal relies on the _Shell Integration API_ to check if commands have completed.
**Without shell integration, some actions may not run correctly.**

To confirm it's enabled, press `Open Settings` or:

1. Open your workspace settings (Code/File > Settings/Preferences > Settings).
2. Search for `Terminal › Integrated › Shell Integration: Enabled`.
3. Check the box to enable the setting.
